# GraphQL Job Board

This is a project used in the [GraphQL by Example](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphql-by-example/?referralCode=7ACEB04674F000BAC061) course.

It uses Apollo Server with Express, and graphql-request or Apollo Client as the GraphQL client. The application is used to explain queries, mutations, custom object types, authentication, etc.

# Extras
 The tutorial only includes example for a React app as client.
 What I've added is an example of using graph ql in an Angular app.
